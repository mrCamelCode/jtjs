[API](/api/view) | [Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jtjs/view)

**Environment**: Any

`@jtjs/view` provides cross-platform utilities for wherever there may be a view. This library is _not_ restricted to the browser! The utilities this library provides simply help you track and interact with data that would be relevant for any view, like the information tracked by the `ThemeService`. 

Just hook into them and use them in your view-specific code!
