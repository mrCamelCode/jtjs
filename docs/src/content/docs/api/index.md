In this section, you'll find thorough API documentation on all JTJS modules that have a public API.

All the documentation is organized by module name. For example, you can find the documentation for `@jtjs/browser`'s API under the `browser` section.

These API docs are generated from source using output from [TypeDoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc), a super handy library. A big thank you to them for all their hard work. You should check out the project!
