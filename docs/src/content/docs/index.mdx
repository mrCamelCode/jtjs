import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Handy" icon="rocket">
    Hit the ground running in your JS project with a suite of libraries that handle the nitty gritties so you can focus
    on the business requirements.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fully Typed" icon="seti:typescript">
    All JTJS modules are implemented entirely in TypeScript, giving you complete type-safety all the way down. Types
    come bundled with our JS bundles.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular" icon="seti:bicep">
    JTJS is a suite of libraries, not a framework. You only need to pull down what you actually want to use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Source" icon="open-book">
    All of JTJS is open source. Curious about how something works? Simply follow the source code link available on all
    of our API pages to go straight to the code.
